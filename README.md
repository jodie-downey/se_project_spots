# Spots Social Media Web Application

## Project Descripton

Spots is a soon to be interactive social media web application designed as a project for Triple Ten. Users will be able to upload photos, like/unlike other users photos and make small changes to their personal profile.

### Project Features

1. Semantic HTML5
2. Flexbox
3. Grid
4. Media Quaries (responsive design)
5. SVG links
6. Page positioning to prevent side sticking
7. Hover and cursor changes
8. Text Wrapping

I utilized a variety of HTTML and CSS techniques to create a responsive layout that accomodates all major screen sizes, as shown below. Care was taken to ensure centered content and prevent "sticking" to the sides throughout all media quaries. Display styling and photos pulled directly from Figma. Fonts integrated directly into the file for improved responsed. SVG photos utilized as much as possible to prevent pixilation of small icons. CSS utilized for ensuring font wrapping as needed.

Flexbox display was used as the primary layout for the profile section of the website, including but not limited to text alignment, photo and button placement. Hover states and curser changes also implemented on the profile section. Note the profile layout changes slightly to accomadate mobile devices.

Grid display was used as the primary layout for the photos. Utilizing grid ensured consistant sizing, spacing and made for minimal adjustments needed as the screen size changes. Note how the grid changes from 3 to 2 to 1 and the screen size shrinks. Flexbox was also utilized for the captions for optimal spacing.
